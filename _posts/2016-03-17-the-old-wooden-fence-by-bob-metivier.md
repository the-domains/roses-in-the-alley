  The Old Wooden Fence by Bob Metivier, released 04 October 2001 The old wooden
  fence Beaten and torn through the years By the wind and the sudden storms -all
  that nature could conspire to bring. Yet it somehow managed to hold firm In
  its simple purpose To keep the strangers out and the restless in.
