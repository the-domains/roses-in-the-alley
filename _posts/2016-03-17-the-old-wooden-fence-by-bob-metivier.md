description: 'The Old Wooden Fence by Bob Metivier, released 04 October 2001 The old wooden fence Beaten and torn through the years By the wind and the sudden storms -all that nature could conspire to bring. Yet it somehow managed to hold firm In its simple purpose To keep the strangers out and the restless in.'
